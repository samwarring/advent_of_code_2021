# Advent of Code 2021

These are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com), implemented in Rust.

Generally, all solution programs read their puzzle input from standard input. Run them like so:

### Bash
```cargo run --bin 01_sonar_sweep <data/01_sonar_sweep.txt```

### PowerShell
```Get-Content .\data\01_sonar_sweep.txt | cargo run --bin 01_sonar_sweep```
